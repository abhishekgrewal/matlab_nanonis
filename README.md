# MatLab Library for Nanonis based files: NanoLib

NanoLib library allows to open and analyze data generated by the [*Nanonis SPM Control System* <sup>TM<sup>](http://www.specs-zurich.com/en/home.html;jsessionid=FCD8A587EE447665C3F4A8CC374671EE) in MATLAB<sup>TM<sup>.

The first version was developed by Quentin Peter during its master thesis *Spin Polarized Field Emission STM and Image Processing* in the Solid State Laboratory for [*Microstruture Research*](http://www.microstructure.ethz.ch) at the ETH Zurich under the supervision of Dr. U. Ramsperger and L. De Pietro.
Some of the features of this library are still oriented to solve problems related to the mater thesis, e.g., *scan_type* field in the header structure (see manual). In next versions some of these feature may be changed and generalized.

## Content

The repository is divided in three sections:
* Manual: pdf of the user manual and source file
* NanoLib: library
* Examples: sample of dummy files and code example for using the library

## Installation and setup

In order to use the library you need to add the path of the library at the beginning of your project with the ```addpath``` standard function of MatLab.

You may use the functions of the library by calling first the ''class'' and than the specific function. Io order to load a SXM image, e.g., you should therefore write ```load.loadSXM```.

A simple example of how to load and to plot an image is given below

```matlab
% load file
fileName = 'SXM_file.sxm';
sxmFile = loadSxM.loadProcessedSxM(fileName);

%% plot data
iCh = 1; % Channel number

%plot image
figure('Name',sprintf('file: %s',fileName));
plotSxM.plotFile(sxmFile,iCh);
```

This and other example can be found in the section *Example*.
