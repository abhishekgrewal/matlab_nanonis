# MatLab Library for Nanonis based files: NanoLib

The NanoLib library allows to open and analyze data generated by the [*Nanonis SPM Control System* <sup>TM<sup>](http://www.specs-zurich.com/en/home.html;jsessionid=FCD8A587EE447665C3F4A8CC374671EE) in MATLAB<sup>TM<sup>.

The first version of NanoLib was developed by Quentin Peter during its master thesis *Spin Polarized Field Emission STM and Image Processing* in the Solid State Physics Laboratory for [*Microstruture Research*](http://www.microstructure.ethz.ch) at the ETH Zurich under the supervision of Dr. U. Ramsperger and L. De Pietro.
Some of this library's features are still oriented to solve problems related to the master thesis, e.g., *scan_type* field in the header structure (see manual). In future versions some of these features may be changed and generalized. Every comment, idea and contribution is welcome.

## Content

The repository is divided in three sections:
* Manual: PDF of the user manual and source file,
* NanoLib: the library with the different MatLab functions,
* Examples: dummy files and code examples for using the library.

## Installation and Setup

You can clone the repository to your computer or download the ZIP file and unzip it to a directory of your choice, for example: ```~/myFunctions```.

In order to use and access the library you need to add the path to the directory where you copied the library with the ```addpath``` standard function of MatLab. Before you begin with your project just type in the MatLab prompt:
```
>>> addpath ~/myFunctions
```

You may use the functions of the library by calling first the ''class'' and then the specific function. For example, in order to load a SXM image, you can simply write ```sxm.load.loadProcessedSxM```.

A simple example of how to load and to plot an image is given below:

```matlab
% load file
fileName = 'SXM_file.sxm';
sxmFile = sxm.load.loadProcessedSxM(fileName);

%% plot data
iCh = 1; % Channel number

%plot image
figure('Name',sprintf('file: %s',fileName));
sxm.plot.plotFile(sxmFile,iCh);
```

This and other examples can be found in the section *Example*.
